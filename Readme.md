# Introduction 
- Project made to call the youtube API and fetch playlist specific metadata.
- Supports pagination of queries, tested for upto 5000 videos per playlist (upto 50 pages approximately, the biggest playlist on the platform). Technically retrieves any and all Youtube videos with ease
- Use your own API Key! the one present in the code has been deactivated (Kept it so I don't have to explain the .env structure).
